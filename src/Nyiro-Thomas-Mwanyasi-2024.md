**Short Professional Introduction**

I'm an enthusiastic individual eager to apply my knowledge to solve real-world problems. While I'm still developing my skillset, I'm a fast learner with a strong work ethic. I'm particularly interested in Database Management and ensuring that databases are efficient, reliable, and secure. Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology's (JOUST) focus on science and technology perfectly aligns with my desire to develop a strong foundation for a successful career in Business Information Systems (BIS).
